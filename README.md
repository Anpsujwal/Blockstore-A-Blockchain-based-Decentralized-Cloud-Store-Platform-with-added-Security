# Blockstore-A-Blockchain-based-Decentralized-Cloud-Store-Platform-with-added-Security
## Overview

**Blockstore** is a decentralized cloud storage platform built on blockchain technology that ensures secure, efficient, and transparent data storage. By leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain, Blockstore enables users to store and manage their files securely while ensuring privacy, data integrity, and protection from tampering.

The platform offers:
- Secure, encrypted data storage.
- Blockchain-based audit trail for file access and modifications.
- Decentralized file distribution and redundancy to ensure availability and prevent data loss.
- Token-based incentivization for nodes in the network.

## Features

- **Blockchain-powered Storage**: Files are divided into encrypted blocks and distributed across multiple nodes in the network.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Files are encrypted at the client-side, ensuring that data is kept private and protected.
- **AES Encryption**: AES-256 encryption is used to securely encrypt files before they are uploaded to the platform, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the stored data.
- **Access Control**: Files are accessed only by authorized users through private/public key cryptography.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure. Files are replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability.
- **Transparent File Management**: Blockchain provides a transparent audit trail, recording every access and modification to the files.
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automate interactions between users and nodes, ensuring secure and trustless file storage transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum or other blockchain networks.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for creating smart contracts to manage file storage operations.
- **IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System for decentralized file storage.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for file encryption and RSA for key management.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the blockchain.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for API and smart contract interactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Solidity and Truffle (for smart contract development)
- IPFS (for decentralized file storage)
  
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
